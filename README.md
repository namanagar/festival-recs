# Festival Recommender

Tool to recommend artists to see at a music festival based on Spotify listening history, built at HackChicago while mentoring.

Uses Vue, Firebase, and the Spotify API. Planning on turning it into a schedule builder/recommender for music festivals but currently just finds artists you should check out at music festivals.
